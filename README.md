# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my repository for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in Java! This repository contains various implementations of common data structures and algorithms to help you understand and practice DSA concepts.

## About

This repository serves as a collection of Java code implementations for various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and algorithms like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more. Each implementation includes detailed comments to explain the functionality and complexity analysis.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on data structures and algorithms. Each directory contains:

- Java source code files implementing the data structure or algorithm
- README.md file providing an overview of the concept, implementation details, and complexity analysis
- Sample test cases or usage examples demonstrating how to use the implemented code

## Contents

Here's a brief overview of the contents of this repository:

- **Arrays**: Implementation of dynamic arrays, matrix operations, etc.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementation of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists, etc.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementations of stack and queue data structures.
- **Trees**: Implementations of binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, etc.
- **Graphs**: Implementations of graph data structures and algorithms like DFS, BFS, shortest path algorithms, etc.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementation of various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Implementation of binary search, linear search, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Implementation of dynamic programming algorithms for various problems.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs, improvements, or additional implementations that could be added, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. Please make sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
